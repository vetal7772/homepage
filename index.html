          <h3>Java as a hobby</h3>
          <p>
            I have a certain attitude to programming since ancient times. When I first
            came to teach at UAD, back in 2004-2007, I had practical in the discipline
            of DBMS (Database Management Systems), ie some experience in 1C and in SQL
            (Access) was gained. None of the experienced teachers wanted to hold such
            classes, so they always put such activities on the shoulders of the
            "young". <br />Sometime since 2012, I was taken several approaches to
            studying JAVA. However, unfortunately, it was not possible to bring it to
            a logical conclusion. It was like a hobby, it was carried out by studying
            literature and some courses (including paid ones, Batyrshinov for
            example), but over time self-motivation was lost, and some life events
            pushed learning into the background. That is, the syntax of Java has not
            advanced. <br />For the last few years, I have been supporting and filling
            the website of our department. That is, some HTML experience, Css is
            available.

            <br />In 2021, I came across a JavaRush course, became interested in the
            game form of submitting material, and in a year reached 40 lvl, which
            seems to be close to the Junior level. However, it is necessary to improve
            a number of technologies SQL, Git, HTML, JS, algorithms, etc. While
            looking for materials I came across the BSA website. And seeing the
            announcement of the set for testing, I decided to try my hand. So I got
